## Installation

> The vecty project is experimental. You should consider it's [issues](https://github.com/gopherjs/vecty/issues/) before putting it into production!

### Install via `go get`

You can install `vecty` by the `go get` command

```sh
go get -u -v github.com/gopherjs/vecty
```

The output should be something like this:

```txt
github.com/gopherjs/vecty (download)
github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs (download)
```

Done!

Now run `go tool doc vecty` to see the documentation. You may also see the documentation at [godoc.org/github.com/gopherjs/vecty](https://github.com/gopherjs/vecty).
