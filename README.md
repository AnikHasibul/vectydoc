### This documentation should be visited outside of github. Because the relatives links seems broken if it loads inside github README.md view

However, still you can see the doc at [https://github.com/AnikHasibul/vectydoc/blob/master/index.md](https://github.com/AnikHasibul/vectydoc/blob/master/index.md)

Also at [https://loserdev.me/vectydoc](https://anikhasibul.github.io) . It serves the same content with github pages. So this is not a fork or different repo.
